# Catering Module Session Handoff

## Authoritative locations

- Repository: `afterburn25/Core_Mods`
- Branch: `module/catering`
- Folder: `modules/industry-catering/`
- Current version: `0.1.21`
- Manifest ID: `cajunwebpro/catering`

Do not develop the catering module directly on `main`, and do not create a
second top-level folder for it. New catering work belongs on this branch and in
this folder. Website Core's `examples/industry-catering/` directory is a tested
release snapshot used to build combined installers; it is not the development
source of truth after this separation.

This branch follows repository `MOD_RULES.md` contract version 1.1. Future
sessions must apply those shared rules before module-specific roadmap choices.

## Current baseline

Version 0.1.21 removes the CSS-generated opaque footer frame from the existing
transparent CATERING CO. logo and slightly enlarges its footer presentation.
The source PNG and the Core-owned live branding contract remain unchanged.
Core 2.0.7 applies one shared social placement to every configured profile;
Catering stays presentation-only and renders Core's filtered header/footer
records.

The module contains its provider, catering controller, initial database
migration, public views, administration views, responsive CSS/JS, four WebP
images, and the transparent generic CATERING CO. logo. The module declares its approved header links through Core's
`navigationMenu()` API. Core imports that declaration once, owns the editable
copy, and returns the current nested tree through `navigationTree()`, so an
administrator can customize or intentionally empty it without defaults
returning. Website Core 2.0.5 supplies shared navigation, users/roles, content,
media, integrations, security, operations, backups, marketplace, and agency
services. Version 0.1.17 declares the starter logo with `brandAssets()`; Core
copies it once and module layouts resolve the live Core logo/favicon through
`brandAssetUrl()`.

## Verification evidence

Core_Mods release commit `13190474e6d786854742b06e23e0691c131dda5f`
passed Module CI run 8 (`40044852033`). The synchronized Website Core commit
`49c124d0292efeb6b7e6965cd93259cc1234e580` passed all six jobs in Core CI run
397 (`40044526443`), including PHP 8.4/8.5, MySQL 8.4, MariaDB 11.4, installer,
Core-only boot, and release artifact contract coverage. The release ZIP digest
is `b182dbd11edbdff03cc52a2bc9ffd83fe5f7b1c125588e6149cf6f5d69eb11cc`.
That is the historical 0.1.16 baseline. The 0.1.21 release ZIP digest is
`4c300c583f658b6ee76c1545c875cfe31404b97894cfaaba27a359b93b2a4d1f`;
both CI runs remain pending because local PHP execution is unavailable in the
current workspace.

## Next safe task

Module 0.1.21 is published on `module/catering` and tracked in draft pull
request #1. Let Module CI finish, verify the synchronized Website Core 2.0.7
bundle, and record the final CI run IDs.
